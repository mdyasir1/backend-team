# Backend – Form Submission Task

## Project Aim
The aim of this backend project is to create a reliable service that handles user form submissions from the frontend and stores the data in a database. The backend is responsible for receiving requests, validating data, forwarding it to the database, and sending appropriate responses back to the frontend. This service ensures seamless communication between the frontend and database teams while maintaining data integrity and accessibility.

---

## Project Overview
This backend service is designed for simplicity, modularity, and scalability. It allows users to submit form data from the frontend and ensures that this data is correctly processed and stored in the database. The backend also exposes endpoints for fetching stored data when needed. The project is structured to facilitate collaboration among team members, integration with frontend and database teams, and deployment to AWS.

**Workflow:**  
Frontend Form Submission → Backend API → Database → Backend Response → Frontend Confirmation

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.11+  
- **Framework:** FastAPI  
- **Validation:** Pydantic  
- **Server:** Uvicorn  
- **Database:** Managed by the database team; backend integrates via APIs or queries  
- **Deployment:** AWS (EC2 / Elastic Beanstalk)  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub

## Process & Structure (Detailed)

### 1. Project Setup
- **Objective:** Create a clean and organized backend structure for easy collaboration.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Initialize a Python project and virtual environment.  
  - Install required dependencies (FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic).  
  - Create project folders:  
    - `app/routers` – for API endpoint files  
    - `app/models` – for data models and validation schemas  
    - `app/utils` – for reusable functions and utilities  
    - `config` – for environment configurations and constants  
  - Set up GitHub repo with proper naming and initial commit.  
  - Create `README.md` with instructions for team members to run the project locally.  
- **Outcome:** A structured, maintainable backend project ready for API development.  

---

### 2. API Contract & Validation
- **Objective:** Define how frontend and backend communicate, and ensure only valid data is processed.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Write API documentation listing all endpoints, request body, and response formats.  
  - Define input validation using **Pydantic models** to enforce data types and required fields (e.g., email format, age > 0).  
  - Share the API contract with the frontend team so they can start integration in parallel.  
- **Outcome:** A clear contract between frontend and backend, reducing errors and confusion.  

---

### 3. Core API Development (Submit Form)
- **Objective:** Implement the main functionality of receiving and storing user data.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Create the **POST `/submit-form`** endpoint.  
  - Receive JSON data from the frontend.  
  - Validate incoming data using Pydantic models.  
  - Forward valid data to the database team’s API or database connection.  
  - Return appropriate success or error responses to frontend.  
- **Outcome:** Users can submit forms, and the data is reliably sent to the database.  

---

### 4. Additional API Development & Error Handling
- **Objective:** Provide additional functionality and ensure backend reliability.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Implement **GET `/submissions`** endpoint to fetch stored submission data (useful for admin or testing purposes).  
  - Implement consistent HTTP status codes: 200 (success), 400 (bad request), 500 (server error).  
  - Create reusable functions for database interaction to avoid code repetition.  
  - Handle errors gracefully, including database connection issues or invalid data.  
- **Outcome:** Backend becomes robust, reusable, and easy to maintain.  

---

### 5. Deployment to AWS
- **Objective:** Make the backend accessible to frontend via a live URL.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Set up AWS environment (EC2 instance or Elastic Beanstalk).  
  - Install Python, dependencies, and configure runtime for FastAPI.  
  - Deploy the backend server with Uvicorn/Gunicorn and configure environment variables for database integration.  
  - Test the live endpoint to ensure frontend connectivity.  
- **Outcome:** Backend is live, deployed, and ready for frontend integration and testing.  

---

## Branching & Collaboration
- **Main Branch:** `main` (production-ready code)  
- **Feature Branches:**  
  - `api-submit-form`  
  - `api-get-submissions`  
  - `aws-deployment`  
- Team members should create **pull requests** before merging into `main` to ensure code review and maintain consistency.  

---

## Team Division
| Person | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| Person 1 | Set up the project structure in the repo and manage all branches. |
| Person 2 | Create API contract and implement input validation rules. |
| Person 3 | Develop the POST `/submit-form` API and integrate with database APIs. |
| Person 4 | Develop GET `/submissions` API, implement error handling and status codes. |
| Person 5 | Deploy the backend project to AWS and ensure public accessibility. |

---

## Notes
- All requests must be sent in **JSON format** with `Content-Type: application/json`.  
- The backend is modular; additional endpoints can be added in dedicated router files.  
- Coordination with the database team is necessary for proper data integration.  
- This repository serves as a foundation for a scalable, deployable backend service that can grow with project needs.
